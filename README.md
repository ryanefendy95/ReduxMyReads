# My Reads

My Reads is an app that I am making from enrolling in [Udacity's React Nanodegree Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) that manages your books. Books that you **are reading**, **want to read** and **have read**. You may also search for certain books and add them to your lists.

The following steps will help install and run **My Reads App** on your local computer.

**IMPORTANT**: `Node JS` and `NPM (Node Package Manager)` is **required** to install and run the application. Visit [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) for more information.
